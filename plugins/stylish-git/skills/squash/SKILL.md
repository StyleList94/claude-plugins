# Squash Commits

Squash multiple commits into a single commit.

## Use Case

- Clean up commits before PR merge
- Combine multiple WIP commits into one
- Maintain clean commit history

## Arguments

| Argument | Description                          | Default |
|----------|--------------------------------------|---------|
| (none)   | All commits from base branch         | -       |
| `<N>`    | Squash only last N commits           | -       |

## Commit Message Format

```text
<subject>

<body - only when a constraint must be preserved>
```

**Do not build a body listing the commits being squashed.** The squash is what discards those
messages; writing them back into the body reinstates exactly what the squash removed, and the
individual commits are not reachable afterwards to make the list verifiable. The list carries
nothing a reader could not get from the PR.

Follow the `commit` skill for everything else:

- **Form** - subject language, prefix style, scope usage, case and length come from Layer 1 of
  the `commit` skill, measured against this repository. Do not assume a convention.
- **Body** - only when there is a constraint a future editor of this code must preserve
  (Layer 2, about three lines). Otherwise the subject is the whole message.
- **Evidence** - measurements, verification and alternatives go in the PR/MR description, not
  in the squashed commit.

Because the squashed subject becomes the whole branch's entry in the history, it must cover
the branch as a unit rather than describing whichever commit happened to be last.

## Process

1. **Safety check**: Prevent running on protected branches (main, master, develop)
2. **Detect range**:
   - No argument: Find merge base with `git merge-base origin/<base> HEAD`
   - Numeric argument: Use `HEAD~N`
3. **Show commits**: Display commits to squash (chronological order)
4. **Measure the repo**: Run Layer 1 of the `commit` skill so the subject matches this repo
5. **Get title**: Ask the user for the subject (using AskUserQuestion), offering a measured-form
   suggestion that covers the whole branch
6. **Build message**: Subject alone, plus a constraint body only when one exists
7. **Execute squash**: `git reset --soft <target> && git commit`
8. **Done**: Show push instructions (user pushes manually)

## Execution Steps

1. Get current branch with `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD`
2. Check if protected branch (main, master, develop)
3. Detect base branch (main or master)
4. Determine squash target:
   - No argument: `git merge-base origin/<base> HEAD`
   - Argument N: `HEAD~N`
5. Show commits with `git log --oneline --reverse <target>..HEAD` (chronological)
6. Measure the repository's commit form (`commit` skill, Layer 1)
7. Ask the user for the subject (using AskUserQuestion)
8. Build the commit message:
   - Subject line
   - A body only when the branch leaves behind a constraint worth recording, about three lines
   - Never a list of the squashed commits
9. Run `git reset --soft <target>`
10. Run `git commit` with HEREDOC for message
11. Show completion message and push instructions

## Safety Features

- **Protected branches**: Never squash on main/master/develop
- **No auto-push**: Only squash, user pushes manually

## Examples

Subjects below are written in the form measured from the example repository. In a repository
with a different measured form, the same skill produces a subject in that form instead.

**Squash all commits:**

```text
/stylish-git:squash

-> Current branch: feature/add-button
-> Base branch: main
-> Commits to squash (3):
   1. abc1234 feat: add button component
   2. def5678 fix: button style
   3. ghi9012 refactor: clean up

-> Measured profile: conventional prefix 97% · scope 5% · lowercase · median 24 / p90 37

-> Enter subject: feat: add button component with styling

-> Squashing...
-> Squashed 3 commits

-> Final commit message:
   +----------------------------------------
   | feat: add button component with styling
   +----------------------------------------

-> Run 'git push --force-with-lease' to update remote
```

**Squash with a constraint worth recording:**

```text
/stylish-git:squash 2

-> Commits to squash (2):
   1. def5678 fix: button style
   2. ghi9012 refactor: clean up

-> Enter subject: fix: improve button styling

-> Final commit message:
   +--------------------------------------------------------------
   | fix: improve button styling
   |
   | The focus ring is drawn with an outline rather than a shadow
   | because the shadow is clipped by the parent's overflow.
   +--------------------------------------------------------------

-> Run 'git push --force-with-lease' to update remote
```

**Protected branch error:**

```text
/stylish-git:squash

-> Error: Cannot squash on protected branch 'main'
-> Switch to a feature branch first
```

**No commits error:**

```text
/stylish-git:squash

-> No commits to squash
-> Current branch has no commits ahead of main
```
