# PR Summary

Write the pull request body for the current branch, then copy it to the clipboard (default) or upload it (`upload` argument).

## The input is the session, not the branch

`git log` and `git diff` show what changed. They cannot show:

- **the causal chain** - the code is the result, not the reason the result happened
- **what was measured** while working, and what it showed
- **which alternatives were considered and rejected**, and why
- **what else was closed** along the way, or deliberately left alone

That is the material worth reading, and it exists only in the working session.

> **The session is the primary input. Git is the check.** Use the log and the diff to confirm the body is complete and accurate - never as the source it is derived from.

A skill that reads only git cannot escape producing a list of changes, and the diff already shows that list.

**Corollary - run this while the reasoning is still in hand**, before the branch is wrapped up, not as a final step that re-derives everything from the log. Once only the log remains, the cause, the measurements and the rejected alternatives are gone. This is the same constraint as the `commit` skill's "draft the review-surface description first": this body is where the evidence lives, and with no home the evidence gets parked in commit messages instead.

## Shape

One shape for every PR. **Do not branch on feature / fix / chore.** Type detection is unreliable, and a per-type template forces empty slots to be filled.

### 1. What was done and why - one to three sentences

For most PRs this is the entire body. Write it and stop.

Where the work is a set of distinct mechanism changes that prose cannot carry, this part may be a short list - at the level of **mechanism**, never of file or commit.

### 2. What the diff cannot show - only when it exists

Four optional slots. Each fills on its own or stays empty. **Never prompt for one that is absent, and never emit an empty heading or "N/A".** Omit the whole part when no slot has content.

| Slot | Content | Fills for |
|---|---|---|
| cause | what produced this behavior, as a chain | a bug fix |
| judgment | why this approach, and what was rejected | a feature |
| evidence | what was measured or verified this time | anything tested |
| side effects | what else closed, or was left on purpose | an investigation |

The work type decides which slots have content. The skill never needs to know the type.

### Rules

- **Brevity is what this skill sells.** The forge already auto-generates a list of commit subjects. What earns this body its place is the handful of things only the session knows. A large template creates pressure to fill it, and that pressure is what produces padded bodies.
- **No section without content.** Same principle as the `commit` skill's "never invent a convention the repository does not already have".
- **No per-change bullet list.** The diff shows what changed.
- **Language.** Write the body, and its headings, in the user's working language. Communicate with the user in that language too.

## Step 1: Gather context

```bash
branch=$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)
default_branch=$(git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD 2>/dev/null | sed 's@^refs/remotes/origin/@@' || echo main)

git log --oneline "origin/${default_branch}..HEAD"
git diff --stat "origin/${default_branch}...HEAD"
git diff "origin/${default_branch}...HEAD"
```

If `branch` equals `default_branch`, or nothing is ahead, stop and say so.

Read the diff to **check** the body you are about to write: everything user-visible in it should be accounted for, and nothing in the body should contradict it. Do not derive the body from it.

## Step 2: Check the branch name against the repo's own pattern

Measure the naming actually in use rather than applying a list from elsewhere:

```bash
git branch -r --format='%(refname:short)' | sed 's@^origin/@@' \
  | awk -F/ 'NF>1 {print $1}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -8
```

If the current branch departs from the observed pattern, say so and suggest a name that fits it. **Do not block** - report and continue.

## Step 3: Build the title in the repository's measured form

Run Layer 1 of the `commit` skill against this repository and write the title in the form it reports: language, prefix style, scope usage, case, and length target. Do not assume a convention the repo does not have.

- If the repo uses a `type` prefix, use the dominant change type across the branch, drawn from the repo's own type vocabulary
- Attach a scope only if the repo scopes its subjects, and only from its existing scope vocabulary
- Never append a `(#N)` reference - the merge adds it

**Measure how the branch will land** rather than assuming squash:

```bash
git log -n 400 --pretty=format:'%p' | awk '{c[NF]++} END {for (k in c) printf "%s-parent: %d\n", k, c[k]}'
```

Nearly all 1-parent means the branch is squashed or rebased, so this title becomes the whole branch's entry in the history and must cover the branch as a unit. A substantial share of 2-parent commits means the individual commits survive and the title names the merge. A repo may be mixed; when it is, write the title as if it will be squashed.

## Step 4: Write the body

Follow the shape above, in the user's working language. Include only the parts that have content.

## Step 5: Detect an existing PR

A PR for this branch may already be open, so the same invocation creates the first time and updates afterward:

```bash
pr_url=$(gh pr view --json url --jq '.url' 2>/dev/null || true)
```

## Step 6: The branch must reach the remote - and that is the user's call

A PR cannot be opened for a branch the remote does not have. **Sending it there is the user's decision, and this skill never makes it silently.** Ask explicitly, and keep working when the answer is no.

First, the upstream guard. A branch created without `--no-track` can end up tracking the default branch, and a bare send would land feature commits on it:

```bash
upstream=$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref --symbolic-full-name '@{u}' 2>/dev/null || true)
remote_has=$(git ls-remote --heads origin "$branch" 2>/dev/null)

if [ -n "$upstream" ] && [ "$upstream" != "origin/$branch" ]; then
  echo "STOP: '$branch' tracks '$upstream', not 'origin/$branch'."
  echo "      Sending it would land these commits on '$upstream'."
  echo "      Fix: git branch --unset-upstream   then re-run."
fi
```

Stop on a mismatch and report it - do not continue to the dispatch step.

Otherwise, if `remote_has` is empty or the branch is behind its remote counterpart, show the user the exact command and ask for approval:

```bash
git push -u origin "$branch"      # no upstream yet
git push                          # already tracking origin/$branch
```

If the user declines, or the session cannot ask, **do not send anything**. Fall through to copy mode, hand over the body, and say that the branch still has to reach the remote before a PR can be opened.

## Step 7: Dispatch

**Default - copy mode:**

The title goes on the first line, because in a squashing repo it becomes the commit subject:

```bash
printf '%s\n\n%s\n' "$title" "$body" | pbcopy
```

Print the title separately so it can be pasted into the title field. If `pr_url` is set, point the user at the existing PR; otherwise tell them a new one can be opened.

**`upload` argument:**

Requires the branch on the remote (step 6). If it did not get there, fall back to copy mode.

- No PR yet:

  ```bash
  gh pr create --base "$default_branch" --head "$branch" --title "$title" --body "$body"
  ```

- PR exists: `gh pr edit` **overwrites** the body, discarding manual edits and checked boxes. Show the regenerated title and body and confirm before editing.

  ```bash
  gh pr edit --title "$title" --body "$body"
  ```

  If the user declines, fall back to copy mode so they can merge the changes by hand.

Report the PR URL.

## Notes

- This skill writes a summary and, with approval, opens or updates a PR. It never commits and never merges.
- The title follows the repository's measured commit form; the body follows the user's working language.
